## üìå Objective

This assignment explores the behavior of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by:
- Implementing different **activation functions** (Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Parametric ReLU).
- Demonstrating how ReLU addresses the **vanishing gradient problem**.
- Comparing the performance of different **ReLU variants**.
- Analyzing the effect of **network depth** on performance with at least five different depths.
